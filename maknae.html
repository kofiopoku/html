<h4>KPOP Magazine Project: Maknae </h4>
<p>This was a magazine project that focused on new magazine ideas that the USA market currently does not have. Because of the recent boom of South Korean Pop Culture, there is no current magazine in the USA about it in English. This was created for new and older KPOP fans alike. This is not a full magazine, but a mock up of what its content and layout would be like. The magazine features table of content pages, department pages, and a feature story.</p>
